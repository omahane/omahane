### Hi, web friend, 

I'm Christian Burk, and I'm using GitHub to work on the [va.gov](https://va.gov) web modernization for [CivicActions](https://civicactions.com).

I worked in the Omaha non-profit community from 1999 - 2020 for the chamber of commerce, symphony, children's museum and a university.

I am sort of addicted to registering domains for projects I never really work on. It's a problem.
